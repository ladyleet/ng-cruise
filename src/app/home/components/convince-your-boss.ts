          ticket, and you can pay for the cruise itself, or show your boss that
          the accommodations + conference ticket breakdown is actually cheaper
          than a hotel and expensed meals because everything is included.</li>

        <h3>How to get company reimbursement for ng-cruise</h3>
        <p>Getting your company to pay for training can be difficult enough
        even if they don’t think you’re going to have fun. Dealing with a boss
        or HR department that may look at this as a paid vacation can be
        difficult, but there are several techniques to get your conference
        covered by your company. Here are some tips to get approval for
        ng-cruise.</p>
        <h4>1. Focus on the Conference</h4>
        <p>When approaching the decision maker, remember to focus on the fact
        that this is a conference, no different to any other developer
        conference. You will still be sitting in a conference room, listening
        to industry experts educate you on the Angular framework, and you will
        be bringing those learned skills and knowledge back to your employer to
        their benefit. Whether you’re in a hotel or on a ship, the time you’re
        at the conference will be no different one way or the other.</p>
        <h4>2. Remember the Networking Benefits</h4>
        <p>One of the benefits of attending a conference is meeting other
        people who can assist you with questions, and may even be interested in
        joining your company. So socializing at a conference is still a benefit
        to your employer. At ng-cruise there will be plenty of socializing
        opportunities that your employer can benefit from.</p>
        <h4>3. Ask for Partial Reimbursement</h4>
        <p>In a typical two day conference, your employer might be paying for
        your flight, hotel, some food, and the conference ticket. Calculate the
        average cost of these items, or pick a specific two day conference and
        calculate them. Then ask for only that amount to be reimbursed, and you
        can cover the rest yourself. Remember that all your food is included
        while on the ship.</p>
        <h4>4. Dealing with Time Away</h4>
        <p>Often one of the big concerns is taking 5 days or more off of work,
        where a typical conference will only be 2 or 3. Ng-cruise is the
        equivalent of a two day conference, so you can ask for just 2 or 3 days
        to be included, and take personal or vacation time for the other days
        you will be gone. For most people you will only be missing 5 days of
        work for ng-cruise.</p>
        <h4>5. Your Own Idea</h4>
        <p>You know your employer best, so use these ideas to come up with your
        own strategy to maximize your reimbursement. We hope to see you at
        ng-cruise!</p>
