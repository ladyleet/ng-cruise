              <h3>Brief</h3>
              <div>
                Learn about RxJS 5 and Observables in-depth, and using RxJS to manage common and complex async scenarios within an application.
Thinking in functional reactive programming can be difficult, but we will give you some fundamentals to go about composing streams.
At the end of this course you'll have built an application that uses both HTTP and WebSockets to create a realtime streaming application.
